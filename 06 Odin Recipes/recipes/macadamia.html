    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        I was served white chocolate macadamia nut cookies at a restaurant in 
        Springfield, MO, during a business conference. Went home and made up this 
        recipe which has been a hit at any church gathering I take them to. They're 
        even better than the one I had at the conference.
