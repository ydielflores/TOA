    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Meat: </b></li>
            This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and
            lean ground beef.
            <li><b>Onion and garlic: </b></li>
            An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked 
            with the meat to add tons of flavor.
            <li><b>Tomato Products: </b></li>
            You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of 
            tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
                
            <li><b>Sugar: </b></li>
            Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and 
            enhance the flavor of the sauce.
            
            <li><b>Spices and seasonings: </b></li>
            This lasagna recipe is flavored with 
            fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, 
            fennel seeds, and black pepper.
            
            <li><b>Lasagna noodles: </b></li>
            Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
            
            <li><b>Cheeses: </b></li>
            Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make 
            this lasagna extra decadent.
            
            <li><b>Egg: </b></li>
            An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the
            lasagna when you cut into it.
           
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Step 1: </b></li>
            Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch 
            oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 
            tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 
            teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
            Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. 
            <li><b>Step 2: </b></li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in 
            boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons 
            parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. 
            <li><b>Step 3: </b></li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            <li><b>Step 4: </b></li>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking 
            dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta
            cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups 
            meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat 
            layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: 
            to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil 
            does not touch the cheese. 
            <li><b>Step 5: </b></li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional
            25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. 
        </ol>
